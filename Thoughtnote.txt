Hello,
I'm Kushal and this is my assignment for FrontEnd Final Project.

Important:

* I've tried to make a Dark mode toggle button, but for now it only works for the current page in which it is turned on. In Future,I'll be making it work as long as the user turns it off.
* As i've included the image links from other website, it may be possible that some of them may not work while evaluation.

Header:
I've made a header which is dynamically loaded to all the pages.
I've used fixed position to make it fixed on scrolling down.
I've used classes and js to toggle the colour of the navbar on clicking the Dark mode button.
I've made my own brand icon using canva.com.
It has a toggler button made for medium and small sized screen.
